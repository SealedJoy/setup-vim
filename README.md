# setup-vim

Script to automatically setup and install vim editor along with plugin manager + plugins with further customistations

requires pip3 package powerline-status and $PY_SITE_PKGS to be set (for this we recommend adding: export PY_SITE_PKGS=$(python -m site --user-site) to your .profile or shell rc file not all versions of python support that command, in which case: manually setting the path to your ~/.local/..../site-packages folder.

install with: pip3 install powerline-status --user
